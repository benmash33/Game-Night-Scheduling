# Game-Night-Scheduling
Game Night scheduling system for a fictional comic book store

Collects a list of dictionaries that include {"name": "NAME", "availability": "Monday, Tuesday, etc."} where the "name" key contains the
value of the player's name and the "availability" key contains the value of the player's weekly availability.

The system analyzes the availability of all players and determines the best night to host their Game Night where the most amount of players
can attend. There is also a section that will schedule a second game night in the week that will accommodate for those who were unable to
make it to the first game night.
